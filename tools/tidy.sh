# Runs clang-tidy over every source file, with the checks in .clang-tidy.
# It catches what the static analyser cannot, reference handling and API
# misuse rather than control flow, so the two are worth running together.

# clang-tidy is not in the FreeBSD packages: devel/llvm<N> has to be built
# with the EXTRAS option. The binary is named after its version there, so
# clang-tidy19 is tried before the plain name.

# Usage: tools/tidy.sh [builddir]        (default: build)
